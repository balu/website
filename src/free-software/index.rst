A program is *free* if it guarantees all users the freedom to
study, modify, and share the program.

I maintain a list of `free software <programs.html>`_ that I
recommend.

I am the author of the following free software.

`cweet <../cweet/home.html>`_
  The reference compiler for the cweet programming language.

`tak <../tak.html>`_
  Create Takahashi presentations.

The `Free Software Foundation <https://www.fsf.org>`_ is a
non-profit organization that promotes software user freedom.
