The Internet is filled with trackers. A tracker is a piece of
software that is automatically downloaded in the background when
you visit a website. It monitors your activity on the website and
sends back this information to the developer of the tracker
software. The DuckDuckGo privacy essentials addon tells me that
almost 50% of websites that I frequent are infested with
trackers. Google alone tracks about 35% of all websites that I
visit. The following addons ensure that my experience on the
Internet is smooth, safe, and free from privacy-invading
trackers.

HTTPS Everywhere
    Allows the browser to connect only to HTTPS websites.
    Websites served over plain HTTP are vulnerable to attacks
    that steal user data without even the user knowing about it.
    With free certificate providers like `Let's encrypt
    <https://letsencrypt.org/>`_, there is no reason for any
    website to use plain HTTP.

uBlock Origin
    Ad blocker. Almost all online ads are used for tracking and
    manipulation. This addon ensures that computing resources I
    own are exclusively used for rendering content that I want to
    see and not for rendering ads.

Privacy Badger
   Blocks known online trackers.

NoScript
   Blocks javascript on pages and allows them to be selectively
   enabled based on domain. Not recommended for casual users as
   most websites require javascript to work.
