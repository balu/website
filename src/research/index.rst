Here's the list of research articles that I have co-authored in reverse
chronological order.

`Graph pattern polynomials <https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.08858>`_ (With Markus
Bl√§ser and Karteek Sreenivasaiah)

  We show that efficient constructions of circuits for computing homomorphism
  polynomials for small pattern graphs can be used to solve the induced subgraph
  isomorphism problem for small pattern graphs. Our main result is that there
  exists a k-vertex pattern graph that has a faster detection algorithm than the
  one for k-clique. This answers an open problem from 1985.

`On the complexity of hazard-free circuits <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01904>`_
(With Christian Ikenmeyer, Christoph Lenzen, Vladimir Lysikov, Andrey Mokhov,
and Karteek Sreenivasaiah)

  A circuit is said to have a hazard if given an input where some of the bits
  are unstable, it outputs an unstable value even if the value of the function
  is determined by the stable inputs. In 1957, Huffman asked whether given a
  circuit that has hazards, is it possible to obtain a hazard-free circuit that
  computes the same function without adding too many gates? In this paper, we
  show that this is impossible. The result is obtained using a newly discovered
  connection between hazard-free computation and monotone computation.

`Comparator circuits over finite bounded posets
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00275>`_ (With Jayalal Sarma and K.S. Sunil)

  The comparator circuit model characterizes the complexity of many interesting
  problems such as the stable matching problem. Intuitively, this circuit model
  appears to be slightly less powerful than arbitrary polynomial time
  computation. In this paper, we study generalizations of the comparator circuit
  model that characterizes polynomial time computation. We also show that
  certain natural restrictions on the comparator circuit model enables us to
  characterize space bounded computation.

`Pebbling meets coloring: Reversible pebble game on trees
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05510>`_ (With Jayalal Sarma and Saurabh Sawlani)

  The reversible pebbling game, played on directed acyclic graphs, was invented
  to determine storage requirements of reversible computation that follows a
  specific algorithm. It was known that this pebbling game is equivalent to many
  other pebbling games invented to study other computational models. In this
  paper, we relate reversible pebbling to a purely structural property of graphs
  called edge-rank coloring. Many interesting structural and algorithmic results
  follow from this discovery.

`On the complexity of L-reachability <https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03255>`_ (With
Jayalal Sarma and K.S. Sunil)

  We look at a generalization of the graph reachability problem where all edges
  are labelled from an alphabet and paths are valid only if the string yielded
  by the path belongs to a language.

`Circuit complexity of properties of graphs with constant planar cutwidth
<https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-44465-8_29>`_ (With Kristoffer Arnsfelt
Hansen, Jayalal Sarma, Sven Skyum, and Navid Talebanfard)

  We show that constant depth circuits can decide the perfect matching,
  3-coloring, and disjoint paths problem on graphs where the vertices can be
  arranged on a constant width grid and edges exist only between consecutive
  layers in the grid.

`Pebbling, entropy and branching program size lower bounds
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1425>`_ (With Jayalal Sarma)

  We look at computational models that solve a problem where the dependence
  between data values can be described using a complete binary tree and the root
  of the tree is the final output. We show that even with the help of
  non-determinism, such models require large storage to solve the problem.

I did my PhD at IIT Madras, India. `Jayalal Sarma
<https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~jayalal/>`_ was my PhD advisor. You can download my
PhD thesis `here <../data/thesis.pdf>`_.
