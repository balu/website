Here is a list of programming languages that I personally like:

  - `Standard ML <https://www.smlnj.org/>`_, `OCaml <https://ocaml.org/>`_: Easy
    to learn functional programming languages. If you are new to programming I
    recommend starting with one of these.

  - `C <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language>`_: Low-level programming
    language in which many foundational software is written.

  - `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_: The scripting language. Python provides
    libraries to do almost everything under the sun.

  - `Common Lisp <https://common-lisp.net/>`_: The ultimate interactive program
    construction experience. Common Lisp development environments allow you to
    interact with your partially constructed program to figure out the missing
    pieces. The language is also extermely malleable and allows you to easily
    extend the language with your own features.
