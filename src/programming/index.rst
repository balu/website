The `cweet <../cweet/home.html>`_ programming language is a
systems programming language designed by me. It provides a safer
alternative to C by eliminating certain dangerous features of C.
On the other hand, it also provides more expressive,
zero-overhead features making it more convenient to use than C.

Here's a list of programming languages I recommend every aspiring
programmer to learn (in no particular order). Pick one from each
bundle.

C, cweet
  Systems programming languages help understand zero-overhead
  abstractions that can be implemented on today's computers.

Lisp, Scheme
  Homoiconic languages allow the programmer to extend the
  language to fit the problem they are solving. Ideal for
  prototyping and incremental development with lots of
  experimentation.

Haskell
  A pure functional language with a strong and expressive type
  system. Ideal for building large programs.

Python, Perl
  These languages provide many convenient high-level features,
  are available almost everywhere, and has libraries for doing
  almost anything. Extremely useful as glue languages.
