Please use my email id on the homepage of this website to contact
me. Follow the netiquette guidelines mentioned in `rfc 1855
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855>`_. Use only plain text
emails. If formatting is essential, then attach the formatted
content as a pdf.  Please wait at least one week for a reply
before sending me a reminder. If you need to contact me urgently,
use my phone number.

I am not on any social networks.

If you wish to send me a private email, remember that unencrypted
emails are more like postcards than sealed envelopes. The only
way to ensure that emails you send to me can only be read by me
is to encrypt them using my `key
<data/bkomarath_public_key.txt>`_. You should also verify the
fingerprint for my key with me through a separate, secure channel
(in person or through phone) before using the key. The FSF has
written an excellent `guide
<https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/>`_ on secure communication
over email. The exact steps to send secure emails depend on the
email client.
